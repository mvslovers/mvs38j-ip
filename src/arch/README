During the MVS38j TCP/IP Xinu port, I tried (but not very hard) to
move platform-specific code to the src/arch source tree.  I concentrated
my efforts on the MVS38j platform, so the other platforms may not even
build correctly.

The platform-specific code and the macros upon which they are dependent
broke down into the following:

	arch/i386	INTEL
	arch/s370	MVS38J
	arch/sparc	SPARC
	arch/sun3 	SUN3
	arch/xinu	<not applicable>

The arch/xinu tree contains code which was not needed for the MVS38j
port, since the Systems/C compiler provides its own runtime environment
that already works under MVS38j.  The code was moved here so the
build process would not find it and attempt to build it.  Most of the
arch/xinu code came from the src/lib and src/h directories.
